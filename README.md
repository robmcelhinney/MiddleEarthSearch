# MiddleEarthSearch | Search text from The Lord of the Rings
Viewable at [https://robmcelhinney.github.io/MiddleEarthSearch/](https://robmcelhinney.github.io/MiddleEarthSearch/)

Attempted to make this website so that it could solely be hosted by Github, no need to use external database or any server side code, a static webpage only.

## Install

    $ git clone git@github.com:robmcelhinney/MiddleEarthSearch.git
    $ cd MiddleEarthSearch
    $ npm install

## Start & watch

    $ npm start

## Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

## Future plans
Store book quotes in sqlite database rather than in json but keep sqlite parsing limited to the client.
